This is an altered version of the exercise from 50 Projects 50 Days | Traversy Media
The original deliverable:  https://50projects50days.com/projects/expanding-cards

The edits I made included:  
- Design style changes (images, color, text, panel layout…)  
- Deactivated the default active panel  
- Clicking the active panel can now make it inactive  

---

In the HTML, there are div panels that contain background images. It is wrapped by containers in a flex row. CSS is applied to make decoration and animated transitions.  

When the panel is clicked, JS will check and either add or remove CSS class active to/from the panel, making the outlook changes (When the panel contains CSS classactive , a different set of CSS rules apply to the panel)
